To run code use:

$ python Dooley_Assignment3.py WorldFile.txt manhattan
$ python Dooley_assignment3.py WorldFile.txt euclidean

WorldFile.txt can be replace by any appropriately formatted file.

I chose the Euclidean heuristic algorithm to try and demonstrate an equation that would be more cost effective but that would potentially take longer to find the final node.
	Euclidean = 10 * math.sqrt(dx**2 + dy**2)
